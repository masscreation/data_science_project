# Course Project Proposal: Workout Warriors


What are two or three potential questions you would like to try and answer? What
data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the
data so far? Why did you choose this data? Upload this as a **MARKDOWN**
file in your the repo you created for the project. Keep in mind these might not
be your final questions, but I want you to start thinking as soon as possible.


I'm planning to predict if NFL Combine performance correlates to career in-game
performance. If so, how much? If not, what are the costs associated with getting
it wrong, both from the player personnel perspective (e.g. drafting non-performing
players early, based on combine performance) and the player perspective (e.g.
being drafted late, based on combine performance, but performing well in career)

I have to scrape combine and statistical data from the NFL's site. I'll have to
clean the data.  The metric for career performance TBD. The NFL already has
a aggregate score for combine performance.

I chose this topic because my brother was chosen in the 6th round based on his
combine performance (particularly the 40yd dash), but later proved to be a
a first round performer.
